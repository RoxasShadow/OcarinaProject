Ocarina2 is a flexible and light CMS builded in PHP5 and MySQL, with OOP
and a rendering engine, wich divides the logic and the graphic.
So, if you're a graphic, just use the simple tag wich the programmer gives you,
otherwise, if you are a web-developer, just search a graphic, and, when you've
found, foul slog :-)

With this CMS, you can create/edit/delete the article and their comments, the
pages (wich are article uncommentable) and the annunce (wich are short message
readable only by the staff of your website).
You can also install/disinstall/edit the various skin wich you/your graphic 
creates.
Then, you can manage the SEO-side: generate sitemap, manage the robots.txt and
(de)active the auto-metadescription/metakeyword.

The user can write a comment for each article and have a personal page, wich
has various fields customizable.
There is also a search engine and a archive.

The target for the final release is set on this summer.
