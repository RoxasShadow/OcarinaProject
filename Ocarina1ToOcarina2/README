There are two script that aim to upgrade your Ocarina1 at Ocarina2 without losing your news and pages.
First, copy `ocarina1.php` in your Ocarina1's directory and run it.
You should will find in this directory two files, `news.sql` and `pages.sql`.
Copy both files and `ocarina2.php` in your Ocarina2's directory, and run this last file.
After you receive your success message, delete from both Ocarina1 and Ocarina2 the files `news.sql`, `pages.sql`, `ocarina1.php` and `ocarina2.php`.

Good luck my boy/girl :D
